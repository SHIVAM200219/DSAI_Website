							<p><a href="head_department.html">Ratnajit Bhattacharjee's</a> research in RF, facilitated
								by a consortium consisting of SAMEER, IIT Madras, IIT Guwahati, and IIT Patna, is
								driving India's efforts towards the development of 6G technology. The advancement of 6G

							<h3>Listening to body sounds: Analyzing respiratory sound signals for design of AI-based
								disease screening methodologies</h3>
							<p>Thanks to improved non-invasive and easy capture of bodysounds using microphones and
								developments in data analysis techniques, acoustic epidemiology aided with artificial
								intelligence (AI) is gaining attention. In this project, <a
									href="https://neerajww.github.io" target="_blank">Neeraj Sharma's</a> group will
								focus on capture of lung sounds, and explore systematic analysis of these sound signals
								using approaches in signal processing and machine learning. The goal is to develop
								methods which allow detecting signatures in the sound signals which are associated with
								specific kinds of respiratory diseases. Know more about a related work on COVID-19

							<h3>School of DS&AI Welcomes 2022 Batch of BTech Students, Expanding Capacity and Igniting a
								Quest for Impact</h3>
							<p>We are thrilled to extend a warm welcome to the incoming batch of BTech students for the
								year 2022 at the School of DS&AI. These students will join us as we collectively strive
								to explore deeper and create a positive impact on our world. The new students have come
								from various regions across India, having demonstrated their exceptional talents by
								excelling in the competitive IIT JEE (All India examination). To familiarize them with
								the School and its programs, an orientation meet was organized on 27th October 2022. It
								is worth mentioning that this year, the School has expanded its intake capacity from
								twenty students in 2021 to thirty students, enabling us to accommodate more aspiring
								individuals.</p>

							<h3>Reinforcement learning for mobile edge computing system</h3>
							<p>In an Internet of Things (IoT) based network, tasks arriving at individual nodes can be
								processed in-device or at a local Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) server. This project, led
								by <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/arghyadiproy/home" target="_blank">Arghyadip
									Roy</a>,
								focuses on the optimal resource allocation problem for tasks arriving in an MEC-based
								IoT network. To address the high complexities of achieving optimality, the aim is to
								develop
								low-complexity task scheduling schemes. Additionally, reinforcement learning
								(RL) based approaches will be developed that can learn the optimal policy by interacting
								with the
								environment. The performance of the RL-based schemes will be evaluated in system-level
								simulators. More details can be found in this <a
									href=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9806731>paper</a> on a
								related work of ours, and a presentation on the same is available <a

							<h3>Analysis of facial tissue movements using AI</h3>
							<p>The eye and facial movements convey subtle
								information about the mental state (e.g., attention, intention, emotion) and
								physical state (e.g., age, health, fatigue) of a person. These movements, which generate
								facial
								expressions, are carefully scrutinized by humans in social settings. <a
									href="https://debanga.github.io" target="_blank">Debanga Raj Neog's</a> lab is
								focussing on developing Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based systems for measuring,
								modeling, and animating eye gaze and facial tissue deformations for applications in
								healthcare and computer animation. The idea is to use high frame rate vision systems to
								capture
								human faces, and apply data-driven approaches to analyze and model facial expressions.
								In
								the healthcare sector, facial movement analysis can be used to develop tools for rapid
								assessments of mental health and to build patient-computer interaction systems. In
								computer graphics, it can help in creating real-time and hyper-realistic
								computer-generated
								animations of human eyes and faces in creating convincing and interactive animation
								characters. Know more <a href="https://debanga.github.io/projects"
