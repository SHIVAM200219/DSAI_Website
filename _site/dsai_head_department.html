												<h3>Message from the Head</h3>
												<blockquote>
												<p>I am delighted to extend a warm welcome to the Mehta Family School of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence at the Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati. Our school stands at the forefront of a transformative era where data and intelligence converge to shape the future.
												<br><br>
												In today's world, data has become an omnipresent force, generated by various facets of our lives, from commerce to healthcare, academia to social interactions. The field of Data Science is the vanguard of this data-driven revolution. It empowers us to extract meaningful insights, make informed decisions, and predict future trends. At our School, we're committed to pushing the boundaries of knowledge in this dynamic field. Artificial Intelligence (AI), often called the pinnacle of human ingenuity, is another facet of our school's expertise. Our mission is to explore, understand, and replicate intelligence, employing computational methods to solve complex challenges. AI, as it continually evolves, holds the promise of revolutionizing how we interact with the world around us.
												<br><br>
												Our academic programs, including BTech, MTech, and PhD in DS&AI, are designed to nurture the next generation of engineers and researchers, equipping them with the knowledge and skills needed to tackle the challenges of data science and artificial intelligence. In 2023, we introduced the BSc (Hons.) in DS&AI online program, making our world-class education accessible to a global audience.
												<br><br>
												Our commitment to progress is reflected in the ongoing construction of a new state-of-the-art building, scheduled to be the cornerstone of our academic pursuits. We welcome you to be part of this journey, whether you're a student, a faculty member, or an organization seeking to collaborate with us. Together, we aim to create, innovate, and advance the frontiers of data science and AI.
												<br><br>
												Thank you for visiting our website, and we look forward to your engagement with the School of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence at IIT Guwahati.
												</p>
